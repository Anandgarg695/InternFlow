**Last updated:** 2026-10-22
**Repository:** https://github.com/Anandgarg695/InternFlow (public)
**How to run, setup, rules and fixes:** see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)

## Done
- [x] Project setup: React frontend, Spring Boot backend, PostgreSQL in Docker, GitHub
- [x] Database migrations with Flyway
- [x] Register, login, JWT, roles (STUDENT, COMPANY, MENTOR, ADMIN)
- [x] Login and register pages, one dashboard per role
- [x] Student profile
- [x] Company profile
- [x] Internships: companies create, publish and close postings; students browse and search (branch `feature/internships`)
- [x] Applications: students apply and track status; companies shortlist or reject (branch `feature/applications`)
- [x] Screening tests: company builds a timed multiple-choice test, shortlisted students take it, scores shown to the company (branch `feature/screening`)

## Doing now
- [ ] Interviews: company schedules interviews for shortlisted students (branch `feature interviews`)
## Next (in this order)
1. Applications: students apply, companies shortlist or reject
2. Screening, tests, interviews, selection
3. Offer, onboarding, mentor, tasks, evaluation
4. Resume upload, mentor profile
5. Advanced features: chat, notifications, coding judge, analytics, certificates
6. Security hardening, tests, deployment

## Notes for teammate
- Add anything useful here: decisions, problems you hit, things to watch out for.
- Internship deadlines are dates in Indian time. A company needs a company name in its profile before it can publish.
- Application statuses: APPLIED, SHORTLISTED, REJECTED, WITHDRAWN. A withdrawn application is final (no re-apply). Students need a complete profile to apply.
- Screening tests: one per internship, multiple choice (4 options), timed. The server owns the clock (deadline saved at start, 15 seconds of grace on submit). Correct answers are never sent to students. A test is locked once any student has started it.
